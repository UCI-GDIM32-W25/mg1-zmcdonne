# HW1
## Devlog
Zoya McDonnell, she/her
Write about how the plan you wrote in the MG1 break-down activity connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.
If you did not attend and perform the W1 in-class activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe MG1 should be built. 
If your plan changed significantly after reviewing the Prof’s example finished plan or because of decisions you made while coding, note what changed and why.
